# pastry-0.1
the first version of pastry. it has many issues and is pre beta tests, but is exists!


this was coded by a developer named stanley, who has no social medias at the moment that i'm willing to give out due to fear of harrassment. 
he has completely gone offgrid. i was the site co-owner and i'm still not sure what to do about any of this but
all i know is that he was all for making everything open source, everything to the people. pastry was meant to be open source originally.
this was our child. we built it together over months and i loved watching it grow.

please, if you use this, credit us. not just me, but him too. even if its just "to stanley whoever you are" because i do not think i knew him that well either.

thank you for everything! -nurse/marcy
